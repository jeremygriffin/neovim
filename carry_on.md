âœ¦ I've analyzed the bug report regarding the :substitute command's live preview. I've identified the cause in src/nvim/ex_cmds.c and applied a fix. I also added a new
  test case in test/functional/ui/inccommand_spec.lua to verify the correction.

  Modified files:
   * src/nvim/ex_cmds.c
   * test/functional/ui/inccommand_spec.lua

  The next step is to install cmake and run make functionaltest-lua to confirm the fix.
